	Rob is trying to learn how to code web. This is an area where I could have a lot of text: for example, I am by far not the biggest game of thrones fan. I haven't read the books and since I haven't seen the show in a few months I am starting to forget some of the characters names and the families they rep. But the show has a lot to do with war politics in an alternate universe where magic and dragons exist and one of the coolest characters is a 'small person' so how can this not be cool? Plus, if you really look into things you see it is chalked full of parallels to modern day goverment and religious bullshit. But instead of going to jail or something boring like that, you get beheaded in front of erryone!!</p>

<h4>Comparisons</h4>
<p>Here are my comparisons</p>

<h5>And headings can get even smaller</h5>
<h6>and this is as small as it gets it seems???</h6>

<div style="color:green">
This text is green because I created a new div style.
<p style="color:blue">This text is blue, but <span style="color: red"> this text is red. </span>
Back to blue again, but...</p>
<p>This text is still green because it is the default color of the div style.</p>
</div>
<p>this text is black because that is the default of this page</p>
