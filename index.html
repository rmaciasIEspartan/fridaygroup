	Rob is trying to learn how to code web. This is an area where we could have a lot of text: for example, In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The internet was without form and void, an text was upon the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and there were links. And Time saw that the links were good; and Time separated the links. And tim saw that the links were good; and blah blah blah </p>
