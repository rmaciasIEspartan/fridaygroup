    Rob is trying to learn how to code web. This is an area where we could have a lot of text: for example, In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The internet was without form and void, an text was upon the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and there were links. And Time saw that the links were good; and Time separated the links. And tim saw that the links were good; and blah blah blah </p>

    <p>Last time I watched GOT:
    <script type="text/javascript"><!--Hide the script from old browsers
    document.write(document.lastModified) ;
    // Stop hiding the script -->
    </script></p>
    <input type="button" onclick="popup()" value="Click Me!">

    <h1>Event Test</h1>
    <button type="button"
            onclick="alert('You clicked the button. Event Test Passed!')">
            Click Me! </button>

    <h1 class="serious">Current Time Upon Page Load  
        <script type="text/javascript">
        <!--
        var currentTime = new Date()
        var hours = currentTime.getHours()
        var minutes = currentTime.getMinutes()
        if (minutes < 10){
        minutes = "0" + minutes
}
document.write(hours + ":" + minutes + " ")
        if(hours > 11){
document.write("PM")
        } else {
document.write("AM")
}
